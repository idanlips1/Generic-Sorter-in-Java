# Generic-Sorter-in-Java
This project implements a Sorter class in Java that supports multiple sorting algorithms, including QuickSort, BubbleSort, MergeSort (without recursion), and RadixSort for long integers. The class is designed to handle generic types (T extends Comparable&lt;T>), allowing for flexible usage with different data types.
